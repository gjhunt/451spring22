The text is not required but highly recommended. 

## Office Hours

Office hours will be held in person in my office Jones 111.  Times will be Tues 3:30-5:00 PM, Weds 9-10AM, 3:30-5:00 PM, Fri 10-11AM. Additionally, I am happy to meet by appointment, send me an email.

## Weekly Quiz Problems (QPs)

Each week I will post a quiz problem (QP) that will be due the following Thursday at 11:59 PM EST. The quiz problem will be graded. In total, your grades on the quiz problems will account for 20% of your final grade. The lowest two QP grades will be dropped. The QPs are intended to be completed alone so do not discuss them with your peers. 

QPs will be submitted on Blackboard under the appropriate assignment. No late submissions will be accepted for QPs. If they are not submitted on blackboard by 11:59 on Thursday a zero will be entered for the grade. By droppping the lowest two grades, missing one or two won't hurt your grade. If there are extenuating circumstances and you cannot submit the problem, please let me know in advance ASAP. 

## Suggested Problems (SPs)

Additionally I will post a selection of suggested problems along with solutions (on blackboard). You are highly encouraged to do these problems as just doing just the one quiz problem will not be enough to prepare you for the midterm and final. I will also post suggested reading along with the suggested problems. 

## Midterms

There will be two in-persons midterms during normal lecture times. The first midterm will be Tuesday March 1st (during lecture) and the second midterm will be Tuesday April 5th (during lecture). The midterms will account for 25% of the grade each. 

## Final

The final exam will be as scheduled by the registrar: Weds. May 11th, 7-10PM EST. The exam will be comprehensive.
